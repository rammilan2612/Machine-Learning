and clustering is the process of finding similarities in customers so that they can be grouped, 
and therefore segmented. They seem quite similar, but they are not quite the same.


Clustering :

“the process of organizing objects into groups whose members are similar in some way” (here)
“a number of different algorithms and methods for grouping objects of similar kind into respective categories” (here)
“a way to form ‘natural groupings’ or clusters of patterns” (here)
“the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations in the same cluster are similar in some sense” 

Segmentation

“Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing, such as age, gender, interests, spending habits, and so on” (here)
“A marketing technique that targets a group of customers with specific characteristics” (here)
